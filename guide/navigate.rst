Smart Navigation
################

Smart Navigation will open source code windows for related components.

It ties together models, views, and controllers; maybe even your libraries 
and helpers.

*************
How To Use It
*************

Press control, and left click inside an editor panel to see links to the related 
components source.

Our plugin are designed for models and views. NetBeans already has some internal
navigation built in ability for libraries and helpers.

************
How It Works
************

Our plugin will search the standard location where views and models are placed
in CodeIgniter to see if there is a view or model file of the same name. 
When the plugin find the file, it will use *Magic* to open the file for you.
